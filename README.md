> Speckle is the first AEC data hub that connects with your favorite AEC tools. Speckle exists to overcome the challenges of working in a fragmented industry where communication, creative workflows, and the exchange of data are often hindered by siloed software and processes. It is here to make the industry better.

# Repo structure

## Usage

Send and receive data from a Speckle Server with `operations`, interact with the Speckle API with the `SpeckleClient`, create and extend your own custom Speckle Objects with `Base`, and more!

Head to the [**üìö specklepy docs**](https://speckle.guide/dev/python.html) for more information and usage examples.

## Developing & Debugging

### Installation

This project uses uv for dependency management, make sure you follow the official [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to get it.

To create a new virtual environment with uv run `$ uv venv` and follow the instructions on the screen to activate the virtual environment.
To bootstrap the project environment run `$ uv sync`. This will install both the package and dev dependencies.

To execute any python script run `$ uv run python my_script.py`

> Alternatively you may roll your own virtual-env with either venv, virtualenv, pyenv-virtualenv etc. Uv will play along an recognize if it is invoked from inside a virtual environment.

### Style guide

All our repo wide styling linting and other rules are checked and enforced by `pre-commit`, which is included in the dev dependencies.
It is recommended to set up `pre-commit` after installing the dependencies by running `$ pre-commit install`.
Commiting code that doesn't adhere to the given rules, will fail the checks in our CI system.

### Local Data Paths

It may be helpful to know where the local accounts and object cache dbs are stored. Depending on on your OS, you can find the dbs at:

- Windows: `APPDATA` or `<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Speckle`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or by default `~/.local/share/Speckle`
- Mac: `~/.config/Speckle`
